# Python-Credit-Churning-Project

The objective of this project is to help predict which customers are more likely to close their credit cards or churn. This would enable the bank to proactively reach out to these customers and offer discounts or other services to retain them.

## Key Learnings

I used the Pandas and Seaborn Python libraries to explore and visualize the data. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to predict customer churn for the bank, I gained the following key insights:
* I learned how to use Pandas Python library to gather and prepare data for analysis, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types to ensure a clean and usable dataset.
*	I developed an understanding of EDA techniques using Python and Pandas, summarizing data with descriptive statistics, visualizing distributions and relationships with Matplotlib and Seaborn, and identifying patterns and trends that could indicate customer churn.
*	I enhanced skills in visualizing data to uncover insights and communicate findings effectively using various types of plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
